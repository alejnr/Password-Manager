# Password Manager

## Class Structure:
- Develop a class named PasswordManager.
- Include necessary private member variables for storing usernames and
passwords.
- Implement public member functions for operations like adding, retrieving,
and deleting passwords, as well as for generating random passwords.
Random Password Generation:
- Within the PasswordManager class, create a function to generate secure,
random passwords.
- Ensure that the generated passwords are robust, incorporating uppercase
and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
User Authentication System:
- Build a simple authentication system in the PasswordManager class.
- Allow users to set a master password for accessing their password
manager.
## Password Storage and Retrieval:
- Implement functions for securely storing and retrieving passwords.
- Ensure that passwords are stored in a way that they are not visible in plain
text.
- Implement functionality to encrypt and store user data (usernames and
passwords) in a file.
- Include the ability to read from this file, decrypt the data, and load it back
into the application.
## Input Validation and Error Handling:
- Validate user inputs, like the format of usernames and passwords.
- Include error handling for incorrect inputs or invalid requests.
## User Interface:
- Develop a straightforward user interface in the main function.
- Provide options for users to add, retrieve, delete passwords, and generate
- new random passwords.
## Secure Coding Practices:
- Code should be free from common security vulnerabilities, such as buffer
overflows and memory leaks. Comment your code to explain how this has
been done.
## Code comments:
- Thoroughly comment your code to clarify your logic and decisions.
## Coding Style:
- Use appropriate coding techniques such as classes, functions, dynamic
memory management.
